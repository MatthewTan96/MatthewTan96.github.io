          This game was interesting because it occurred right after my brother asked me if a bishop was stronger than a knight
          to which I answered "that purely depends on the position of the board". After that I showed him this game.
          <br><br>
          To answer the question, bishops are stronger in "Open Positions", where the pawns are free to move around and are not locked in place. 
          A bishop can travel across the board while a knight cannot. A bishop can guard all advancing squares of the knight, making it stronger
          if fully mobile. This game shows an example of a monster bishop pair, and how I forced the opponent to trade a knight for a bishop. 
          Be sure to check my notes as you scroll through the game!

        3. Qh5 is typically considered a very amateurish move. 
        The aim of that is to try and achieve #Qxf7 checkmate.
        ... e6 is the only way to stop checkmate and defend the c5 pawn.
        <br><br>
        
        10. Qe4 shows that my opponent is willing to trade a bishop for a knight, 
        a trade he will soon regret. The pushed pawns are blocked (e6 and c5), but 
        they can be opened quickly. A thought that never occured to him at the time.
        
        <br> <br>
        
        12. Qh4 loses a pawn as shown in the subsequent moves.
        <br><br>

        14. Nf3+ forces a trade of a knight for a bishop. No matter he the opponent recaptures
        (gxf3 or Nxf3) I will take his bishop (Bxb2) with tempo as I am attacking his rook at the 
        same time. ... gxf3 is a weaker move than Nxf3, as his knight is stuck in the corner with 
        almost no squares to go to. 
        <br><br>
        22. Rxe8+ Remember! If you position is losing, never trade! However this guy keeps doing it!
        <br><br>
        28. Nf4 loses his rook, as I have a discovered attack on his rook as you will see in the next 
        moves.
        <br><br>
        30. ... Ra1+ forces the king off the protection of the knight, and he loses yet another piece.
        Game over.
