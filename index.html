            Hi everyone! Nice to meet you! My name is Matthew, and I'm a student studying for my Bachelor of Science 
            in Informations Systems (BSc SIS) in SMU.
            I've only been coding for a small period of time but I have started to love it a lot, 
            and I decided to create this website to show off some of the projects that I have been working on, 
            ones that I have completed and ones that I am going to start as a hobby in my spare time.
            Please look at the navigation bar above, and click on what you would like to find out about me! </p>
